I have kept example-image-2 as ADRAIN'S IMAGE , ADRAIN is a great teacher and his blogs are an actual goldmine of knowledge.


This is A face mask detector project and it detects wheather or not the person in front of the camera is wearing a mask or not.


Makes use of TENSORFLOW, KERAS , OPENCV2, FACE_RECEGNITION and NUMPY libraries.
